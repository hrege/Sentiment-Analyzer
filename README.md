Python script that employs sentiment classification tools in Python to properly analyze different data sets. The data set used for this particular project was the Cornell Movie Reviews (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/) and local Yelp restaurant reviews. The Cornell reviews were classified as simply positive or negative, while the Yelp reviews were classified on a 1-5 star rating system.
